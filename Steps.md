## Steps
### Step 1 -- Creating first FLTK project and building
Create a new project in Code::Blocks and use the 'FLTK project' template. Use proper project name. On the next window select the button next to the FLTK's location text box. Close the window which appears with a lot of text boxes and buttons. It will ask if you want to save invalid value for the variables, click 'no'. A file browser will appear, select the fltk folder, example 'D:/fltk-1.3.4-1'. Click on next. Use the 'simple main() example' and click on next. Finish the wizard.  
There will be some code automatically generated by Code::Blocks which can be seen in sources->main.cpp. The code in this repository has been commented to explain each line. You can easily see how easy and intuitive hello world in FLTK code looks. A window is created, then a box is created to display something on the window. Different properties of the box are then set. Then finally we make the window appear and transfer the control to FLTK which will exit when the window is closed.  
The only magical portion here can be that we never added `box` to `window` but fltk automatically did that. It is because whenever we create widgets which can contain other widgets, they are set as current grouping widgets. Then whenever we create some other widget, it is automatically added to current grouping widget. Hence we need to call `window->end()` to tell fltk not to add any more widgets to window.  
Feel free to google about other GUI APIs for C++ and look at their hello world programs. Then you can actually see how much effort we saved by using FLTK for this project. Happy Coding! :)

## Steps
### Step 1 -- Creating first FLTK project and building
Create a new project in Code::Blocks and use the 'FLTK project' template. Use proper project name. On the next window select the button next to the FLTK's location text box. Close the window which appears with a lot of text boxes and buttons. It will ask if you want to save invalid value for the variables, click 'no'. A file browser will appear, select the fltk folder, example 'D:/fltk-1.3.4-1'. Click on next. Use the 'simple main() example' and click on next. Finish the wizard.  
There will be some code automatically generated by Code::Blocks which can be seen in sources->main.cpp. The code in this repository has been commented to explain each line. You can easily see how easy and intuitive hello world in FLTK code looks. A window is created, then a box is created to display something on the window. Different properties of the box are then set. Then finally we make the window appear and transfer the control to FLTK which will exit when the window is closed.  
The only magical portion here can be that we never added `box` to `window` but fltk automatically did that. It is because whenever we create widgets which can contain other widgets, they are set as current grouping widgets. Then whenever we create some other widget, it is automatically added to current grouping widget. Hence we need to call `window->end()` to tell fltk not to add any more widgets to window.  
Feel free to google about other GUI APIs for C++ and look at their hello world programs. Then you can actually see how much effort we saved by using FLTK for this project. Happy Coding! :)  

### Step 2 -- Create basic GUI and menu bar
We will create 4 buttons and a box in this tutorial. The box will be used to display the image and the buttons will be used to switch images, zoom or delete an image file. We also created Menu bar which can be used later for opening images. Most of the code is explained in comments. As it can be seen, FLTK relies heavily on callbacks, like most of the GUI libraries. So we need to make callback functions for every function. When a widget is invoked/clicked it calls the callback function which can do the required work.  
Also, there was one error in comments of the previous commit, it was mentioned that the starting 4 paramters to constructor of Box are coordinates of top left corner and bottom right corner of the box. But the first two parameters are coordinates of top left corner and the later two parameters are width and height of the box respectively. Sorry for the error.  
In this step, we see how intuitive and functions based model FLTK is. This simplicity comes with a slight price that the GUI from FLTK is not so nice looking. But for beginning GUI programming simplicity should be given more importance. Once you have mastered FLTK, learning other more complicated GUI libraries will become quite easier (either on your own or from upcoming OWPs).  

### Step 3 -- Opening and image from file dialog box
In this step, we create utilities.h and utilities.cpp files and add a function which loads an image from file path. The code is self explanatory with some comments. We also make our image box global and change the image on it in the `open_cb` callback. The code has been explained in comments. We need to redraw the image box after changing the image as, like all GUI APIs, fltk avoids redrawing everything to reduce unnecessary overload. In the next step we will add a list to our program and let the user view all the files from a certain directory rather than just a single image.  
This step is small, you can use fltk documentation to view all the FLTK classes and functions and how to use them.
